// Only grid squares with the class of 'allowed' are allowed to be clicked. Create an alert if not
// After each allowed turn, the grid square is given class of player-one or player-two and the turn changes between player 1 and player 2
// When an allowed grid square is clicked, the 'allowed' class is removed from that square and a new class of 'allowed' is added to the square above. Can do this by subtracting 7 from the value of the square
// Figure out how determine winner!
